# Dragtor / react-dragtor
_A not so fully featured drag and drop library._

## Contents
This monorepo includes:
* react-dragtor (packages/react-dragtor)
* react-dragtor-driver-html5 (packages/react-dragtor-driver-html5)
* react-dragtor-example (examples/react-dragtor-example)

## Documentation
The main documentation can be found in the [react-dragtor](./packages/react-dragtor) package.

Some examples on how to use the react-dragtor-driver-html5 without react-dragtor can be found in
the [react-dragtor-driver-html5](./packages/react-dragtor-driver-html5) package.

## Features
_Some of them might also be just wished for._
- [ ] Drag and Drop between IFrames.
- [x] Update the state of drag source when dragging.
- [x] Update the state of the drop target, if dragged item is hovering above it.
- [x] Nested drag sources/drop targets.
- [ ] Removing (or just hiding) of the drag source possible (could be used when
  interactively sorting lists with drag and drop).
- [x] Dropping at the edge of drop targets (to insert items next to the side).
- [x] Runnable in all major browsers (maybe even IE).
- [ ] Native (e. g. files) drop support.

## TODO
Current priorities:
- [ ] Make better example(s).
- [ ] Write tests for examples.
- [ ] Extend E2E tests.
